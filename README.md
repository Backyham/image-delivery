# Delivery!

I want a photo delivery system that's self-host-able. 

Not necessarily free - Need server anyway - but free software at least.

## Functions to implement

1. Photographer - Upload/Client - Download images
2. Client - categories/tags for picture selecting, commenting and printing requests for Photographer
3. Client - Shortcut to directly share photos to social media
